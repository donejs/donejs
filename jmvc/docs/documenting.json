But, it \ngives you a great place to \nstart.  Open <strong>cookbook/cookbook.md</strong>. This is the top level\npage for the cookbook application.  Notice that it's markdown!</p>\n\n<p>The syntax for documentation is very similar to JavaDoc.  However, there are some \nimportant differences.  Consult the [DocumentJS DocumentJS's documentation]\nfor more information.</p>\n\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n\n<p>In the context of this trivial application, you've \nbeen exposed to major features of JavaScriptMVC: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>code separation</li>\n<li>testing</li>\n<li>compression</li>\n<li><p>documentation</p>\n\n<p>This is pretty cool! Look at how simply you went from \nnothing to a compressed, tested, and documented application.</p></li>\n</ul>", "title": "Documenting Cookbook", "parents": ["getstarted"], "order": 3, "src": "tutorials/getstarted/documenting.md", "children": []})
