@description Help us improve CanJS, StealJS, and the rest of the DoneJS family
by taking a short email survey every six weeks.

@body

We want to hear from you. What do you love and hate about CanJS, DoneJS, and
StealJS? What can the core team work on to make you grow fonder of these
projects?

<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js"></script>
<script>
  hbspt.forms.create({
    css: '',
    portalId: '2171535',
    formId: '45da8caa-c096-4099-a444-450f5c303ba0'
  });
</script>

Provide your email address (and optionally your GitHub username) above and
you’ll be signed up for our survey:

- You’ll receive an email about
[every six weeks](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jupiterjs.com_g27vck36nifbnqrgkctkoanqb4%40group.calendar.google.com)
with a link to the survey.
- Each survey will be about seven questions and take just a few minutes to complete.
- An opt-out/unsubscribe link will be included in each email.

We will look at every single response and use it to prioritize what the team
works on in the coming months. Short of [hiring us](https://www.bitovi.com/contact)
to work on something in particular, this is the best way to have a direct impact
on our priorities.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask on
