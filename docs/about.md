DoneJS' goal is to help the JavaScript community make, and continue to make, amazing applications. 
DoneJS is rebuilt and rebranded from the over 8-year-old [JavaScriptMVC](http://javascriptmvc.com) 
project. DoneJS is built of many sub-projects, each useful in their own right. Learn about the goals, history, projects, and 
team behind DoneJS.

## Goals

DoneJS has three primary goals:

1.  To make it easy to build and maintain high performance, real time, web and mobile (amazing) applications.
2.  To continually evolve with new techniques and tools.
3.  To support the technology community.

### Amazing Applications

Building a world-class application is difficult.  Ideally, it runs on every machine, runs fast, and provides
a great user experience. But getting "DONE" on time is even harder. Maintainability is critical.  

DoneJS
attempts to solve front-end development the 
way [computers solved checkers](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computers-solve-checkers-its-a-draw/). It
does this by providing or integrating great technology solutions to difficult problems:

- Server Side Rendering
- Automatic real-time updates
- Builds to mobile and desktop
- Optimal builds deployed to a CDN

To help with maintainability, DoneJS makes sure what a developer should be doing is as easy as possible:

- Tests and Documentation
- Guides for CI and CD
- Modlets
- Generators

### Evolve

Learn from others. Provide the ability to upgrade without having to rewrite everything.  Changes will happen,
but stepwise.  

Provide examples of this.

### Community

 - Teach - Our tech is worth nothing if people don't know how to use it.  We have a weekly training, and post
   training videos.  We also have "free" single trainings anywhere people can assemble 10 people.  If you'd
   like a free DoneJS training please email. Our full time team is always available to chat on gitter.
   
 - Explore - DoneJS's parts should work with everything.  StealJS works great with ReactJS.  CanJS works
   with RequireJS or Browserify.  can-connect works on its own.  Different combinations suite people differently.  
   Our goal is to enhance other communities with DoneJS's technology.
   
 - Attract - If you have the next great JS idea, we want to encourage you to help build it as part of the DoneJS
   family.  You'll find DoneJS a supportive environment to nurture your ideas.  You can even pair with the full
   time devs to build out your idea.


## History

DoneJS's history goes back more than 8 years!  Learn why JavaScriptMVC was started, and how it
evolved into DoneJS.

### Beginning Insipration

Brian and Justin were trying to make something like Filemaker pro, but for the web. They
were young and stupid.  To make something so complex, as a SPA, they need things like:

- Templates
- A build system
- Event delegation
- A model
- Testing

### Middle Challenges

Maintaining all these projects was too much. And it was a big pill to swallow. So we started to break out our tech.

And, these projects were based on Rhino, not node.  So we set out to update EVERYTHING and
solve some of the biggest remaining struggles - real-time, ssr, different builds.


### Today's Effort

After releasing DoneJS, our team will be almost exclusively focused on 
DoneJS's community, training, and documentation. DoneJS is amazing, but without getting
people the skills they need to effecitvely use it, it will go to waste.

- How can people get involved?
- 

### Tomorrow's Roadmap

- StealJS's dependency injection
- DirtyChecking 
- can-connect supporting other frameworks
- Other MV*\ support?
- Animation utilities

## Projects

Whole is greater than the sum of its parts

DoneJS is comprised of many projects.  There are 1st party projects, where there
is a high degree of overlap of the teams working on these projects, and 3rd party projects like
jQuery that DoneJS uses, we occasionally contribute to, but are maintained by outside teams.

### CanJS

### can-ssr

### can-simple-dom

### StealJS

### steal-tools

### steal

### DocumentJS 

### FuncUnit

### jQuery++

### 3rd party projects

jQuery, QUnit, Cordova, NW.js



## Team

The DoneJS family of technologies is built by 100s of contributors:


### Core team

To become a contributor to DoneJS or its sub-projects, you simply have to:

- email the core team expressing your interest.
- attend a monthly meeting
- make one small contribution, even a spelling correction, a month.

### Fulltime team

 - David
 - Matthew
 - Justin

### Bitovi

Bitovi, a JavaScript consulting company, is the primary sponsor of DoneJS. If you would
like to sponsor development, please contact.
