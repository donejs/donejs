Its completeness is itself a feature.\n\nThere's no mixing and matching pieces of your stack. Just `npm install` and get started.\n\nChoosing a modern stack is not at all simple or straightforward.\n\n1. *What types of tools do you want?*   Server-side rendering? What is a virtual DOM? Do I need one? MVVM or Flux? Should I set up testing infrastructure? Documentation?\n\n2. *Choose all your pieces.* The good news is, you have [many choices](http://microjs.com/#). The bad news is, you have many choices. React, Angular, or Vue? WebPack, rollup, or parcel? Mocha or QUnit? What tool will run my tests?\n\n3. *Finally, you have to make sure your chosen tools work together effectively.* Does parcel work well with Angular? Does Karma work with Browserify? What about React and Babel?\n\nDoneJS gives you a full solution. It's our mission to eliminate any ambiguity around choosing technology for building an app, so you spend less time tinkering with your stack, and more time actually building your app.\n\nAnd as we've proven [over the last 8 years](./About.html#evolve), we'll keep updating the stack as the state of the art evolves over time.\n\n### Integrated layers\n\nJust like Apple integrates the hardware and software for its devices, DoneJS integrates different technologies in a way that creates unique advantages that you can only get from using an integrated solution.\n\n#### Cross-layer features\n\nDoneJS makes it easier to do things that are not possible, or at best DIY, with competitor frameworks, by spanning technology layers. Here are a couple examples:\n\n##### 1. [Server-side rendering](#server-side-rendered)\n\nServer-side rendering (SSR), which you can read about in more detail in its [section](#server-side-rendered) below, spans many layers to make setup and integration simple.\n\nIt uses [zones](https://davidwalsh.name/can-zone) to automatically notify the server to delay rendering, [hot module swapping](#hot-module-swapping) automatically integrates (no need to restart the server while developing), data is cached on the server and pushed to the client (http/2 server [PUSH](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/guide-http2-server-push/) or [Preload Links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content) for http/1.1) automatically and used to prevent duplicate AJAX requests. Support for these features is only possible because of code that spans layers, including can-zone, done-ssr, CanJS, and StealJS.\n\nBy contrast, React supports SSR, but you're left to your own devices to support delaying rendering, hot module swapping, and request reuse.\n\n##### 2. [Progressive enhancement](#how-it-works-1)\n\nParts of your application can be progressively loaded using [steal.import](https://stealjs.com/docs/steal.import.html):\n\n```js\nimport { DefineMap } from \"can\";\n\nexport default DefineMap.extend(\"AppViewModel\", {\n  page: \"string\",\n  get pageComponent() {\n    let moduleName = `~/pages/${this.page}/`;\n    let Component = (await steal.import(moduleName)).default;\n    return new Component();\n  }\n})\n```\n\nand then running `donejs build`.\n\nDoneJS' generators define anything within `~/pages` to be split into bundles. This feature spans StealJS, steal-tools, and donejs-cli.\n\n#### Story-level solutions\n\nAnother advantage of the integration between DoneJS' parts is the ability to solve development problems on the level of [**stories**](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story) rather than just features.\n\nSolving a story means a packaged solution to a development problem, where several features across layers converge to solve the problem from start to finish. Here are several examples of stories that DoneJS solves:\n\n1. [Modular workflow](#modular-workflow) - DoneJS makes it possible for teams to design and share components easily. Starting with [generators](#generators), users can create [modlets](#modlets) that encapsulate everything a [custom element](#custom-html-elements) needs, easily add [documentation](#documentation) and [testing](#comprehensive-testing), then use [npm import and export](#npm-packages) to easily share the modules with other developers, no matter what module format they're using.\n\n2. [Performance](#performance-features) - DoneJS was designed from the start to solve the performance story, packaging [server-side rendering](#server-side-rendered), [progressive loading](#progressive-loading), [worker thread rendering](#worker-thread-rendering), [data layer caching](#caching-and-minimal-data-requests), and more, all under one roof.\n\n3. [Maintainability](#maintainability-features) - [testing](#comprehensive-testing), [docs](#documentation), [MVVM](#mvvm-architecture)\n\n4.  Developer efficiency - [zero-config npm imports](#npm-packages), [hot module swapping](#hot-module-swapping), [ES6 support](#es6-modules)\n\n### Feature comparison\n\n<div class=\"matrix-wrapper\">\n
